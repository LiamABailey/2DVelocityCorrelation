# 2DVelocityCorrelation

Implementation of the velocity correlation algorithm used in 'Self-concentration and Large-Scale Coherence in Bacterial Dynamics', Dombrowski et al; 'Cytoplasmic streaming in Drosophilia oocytes with kinesin activity and correlates with the microtubule cytoskeleton architecture', Ganguly et al.

Core function `square_input` is available in `velocitycorrelation2D`, other functions to format the data can be found in `velocitycorrelation2D.velutils`

`import velocitycorrelation2D as vd`  
`from velocitycorrelaction2D import velutils`


## Velocity Correlation as a Function of In-Plane Distance

Domrowski et al. proposes the following algorithm to compute velocity correlation over a collection of velocity vectors:
<p align="center">
  <img src = "READMEAssets\correlation_eq.png" alt="I(r_{||}) = \frac{\langle v(x_{||}+r_{||})\cdot v(x_{||})\rangle_x - \langle v \rangle^{2}_x}{\langle v^2\rangle_x - \langle v \rangle^{2}_x}"/>
</p>

Where:
 - x_|| is the point (x,y)
 - r_|| is the in-plane distance
 - v(x_||) is the velocity at point (x,y)

This correlation is averaged across an unspecified number of orientations - this implementation reviews 8 orientations, each separated by 45Â°, to measure the correlation of velocities across a given distance r_||.

## Processing via the command line using `calc_spiral_corr.py`

A script, `calc_spiral_corr.py` , has been written to support the calculation of the radius measure against tabular data. This process takes a single .csv as input (describing velocity in one frame), and returns a single .csv as output (describing the correlation across the desired radii). It supports a variety of inputs to configure the process, allowing for control over the measurement radii, and variations in file structure. Results are returned with respect to the radius size, where a radius unit of 1 is equal to the minimum distance between any two points in the X or Y coordinate spaces. Note that scales in the X and Y coordinate spaces are required to be equal, and that the program automatically attempts to identify these scales.


The help text (which can be recovered by the -h flag, is shown below).

Sample command: <br/>

    python calc_spiral_corr.py C:\Users\Liam\Documents\Projects\2020\radial_correlation_measure\data\px_basis\PIVlab_0001.txt C:\Users\Liam\Desktop\test_output.csv --ds 2 --rmin 1 --rmax 50 --pxstep 5

## Using the provided package
The function `velocity_corr()` expects square data (s.t. all observation points are evenly spaced, and the y-velocity unit is the same as the x-velocity unit) as an `n*m*2` matrix, where `n` is the size of the y-dimension, `m` is the size of the x-dimension. The last dimension is depth-2, where the first layer is the x-velocity component, and the second layer is the y-velocity component.

As data is not always readily available in the above format, a number of functions, importable via `velocitycorrelation2D.utils` have been created to import and shape data:

- `find_conversion_factor()`:
  - Used to detect the conversion factor to convert from the floating-point positional measurements to the integer grid space, where each point's immediate neighbors are [-1,0,1] away in the x/y coordinate spaces
- `rescale_positions()`
  - Some scientific applications provide data where vector start points separated from one another by more than one pixel (such that division by a number *x* would place all observation points 1 pixel away from neighbors in the x/y coordinate space). This function (applied to the tabular data) rescales the positions s.t. they are one pixel away, and sets the minimum coordinate to (0,0).
- `square_input()`
  - Given the input dataframe with rows of [x-coord, y-coord, x-vel, y-vel], coverts from tabular format into the desired `n*m*2` matrix

**Note** If using both functions, `rescale_positions()` must be used first - `square_input()` returns a data format not accepted by `rescale_positions()`
